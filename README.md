## Seq2Seq (attention based) 
Go to https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt for the extensive code and Tutorial.
The data is from [Stanford](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/). 
I have used English-Vietnamese Translation dataset for this demo.

./dataset.sh (To the desired path)

* Parameters setting:<br />
First set the paths to Train,Development files in [Params](https://github.com/ManniSingh/mt/blob/master/params.json).
__Don't set anything for the test in Params yet!__

* Go to the [mt](https://github.com/ManniSingh/mt/blob/master/mt.ipynb) notebook to understand and run the code. 
* Train the model
* Test it by setting paths to test file or make a file to test!
